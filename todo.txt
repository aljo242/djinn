TODO for vulkan FW

- find out mysterious growing memory bug

rewrite the entire thing because now I know what is going on

create abstractions for objects, rather than having monolithic master class

gpu : properties, memory, formats
context : instance, extensions, gpu, surface, semaphores (sync objects)

switch phrasing around semaphores to "acquire" and "render"
"acquire" - get next image from swapchain
"render" - ensure image is ready to be rendered to (or is finished)
